Good morning, :name.

Despite years of investment in compensation, products, training, and digital tools, one challenge in life insurance still remains the same: sustaining agent activity and performance.

Across the industry, agent disengagement continues to erode growth and return on investment.

From an analysis of eight thousand three hundred eighty newly recruited agents across year 2024 and 2025, the numbers are clear:

63 percent active in Month 1.
10 percent active by Month 3.
Only 5 percent active by Month 6.

That means 95 percent of new agents disengage within six months.

Each disengaged agent represents wasted recruitment cost, training cost, manager time, and lost APE. At scale, this translates into millions in unrealized revenue every year.

Now, here is the opportunity.

If we improve agent activity by adding just 10 percentage points at each monthly cohort:

APE increases by 57 percent by Month 6.
APE increases by 91 percent by Month 12.

This is achieved without increasing commission, without new products, and without hiring more agents.

This is not a training issue. It is an engagement and execution gap.

Insurance is, at its core, a people business. But managing agents at scale today requires both science and human connection, using data and AI, reinforced by recognition, motivation, and timely coaching.

That belief led me to cofound CeMoCA.

CeMoCA is an agent engagement and performance activation layer, delivered through WhatsApp where agents already engage, achieving up to 98 percent read rates.

Each agent receives 8 to 10 personalized, structured touchpoints per month, including instant recognition for issued cases, clear progress and balance-to-go updates, micro learning on Day 14 and Day 28, monthly kick-off message and incentives, month-to-date and year-to-date performance summaries, and birthday and festive greetings.

All automated. No new systems. Low operating cost.

Most importantly, every message is tailored to the individual agent.

The result is higher activity consistency, better early-stage retention, stronger ROI on recruitment and training, and material APE uplift, without expanding headcount.

CeMoCA does not replace your existing systems. It activates them.

In summary, CeMoCA helps insurers build a stronger, activity-based sales ecosystem, delivering more consistent performance and better retention.

We believe CeMoCA is a practical transformation initiative for the 2026 action plan and a clear signal to your agency force that the company is changing how it supports agent success.

Thank you. I look forward to continuing the conversation.
